    <h1>Ingredients:</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>Chicken: Most commonly, boneless, skinless chicken breasts are used for a lean option, but you can use thighs or whole chicken depending on the recipe.</li>
        <li>Oil: Olive oil is the most common choice for its flavor and ability to help the chicken brown.</li>
        <li>Seasoning: Salt, pepper, and garlic powder are essential seasonings, with additional herbs like rosemary, thyme, or oregano adding depth.</li>
        <li>Marinades (optional): Some recipes might include a marinade with lemon juice, yogurt, or a combination of herbs and spices to enhance flavor and moisture.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h1>Steps</h1>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375째F (190째C).</li>
        <li>Prepare the chicken by patting it dry with paper towels to remove excess moisture.</li>
        <li>Brush the chicken with olive oil or melted butter to help it brown and retain moisture.</li>
        <li>Season the chicken generously with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and any additional herbs or spices of your choice.</li>
        <li>Place the chicken in a baking dish or on a sheet pan lined with parchment paper or foil for easy cleanup.</li>
        <li>Bake the chicken in the preheated oven for 20-30 minutes for boneless breasts or 35-45 minutes for bone-in pieces, depending on thickness.</li>
        <li>Check the internal temperature with a meat thermometer to ensure it has reached 165째F (74째C).</li>
        <li>Remove the chicken from the oven and let it rest for 5-10 minutes to redistribute the juices.</li>
        <li>Serve the baked chicken warm and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
